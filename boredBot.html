                <h1>ðŸ¤– The Bored Bot</h1>
                <p>I built a bot that will give you one interesting activity to do if you're bored. I used HTML, CSS, and an API to make this magic.</p>

                    <p class="main-post__paragrah-title">How I built it</p>
                    <p>I created a basic html page with simple elements like a div, h1, and button. Then, I added a GET request to make an API call.</p>
                    <p class="main-post__paragrah-title">What problems did I overcome?</p>
                    <p>This was my first attempt writing a GET request and pulling data from an API with a hardcoded project. I've used "nocode" tools in the past like Zapier. It was a great feeling to see the data logged in my console and then on the screen. Adding some JS to the button which makes additional GET requests and changes the text content on the screen was simple yet deeply satisfying. ðŸ˜Œ</p>
