                <h1>My New Journey as a Bootcamp Student</h1>
                <p class="blog-par">After years of wanting to become a prolific builder, I joined the Scrimba Frontend Developer Bootcamp!</p>
                <p class="blog-par">I was tired of being a media buyer and data analyst. The pay was GREAT (over $100k+ per year) but the work simply wasn't rewarding.</p>
                <p class="blog-par">Inspired by indie hackers like Peter Levels, Dru Riley, and Danny Postma, I started building products that people actually enjoyed <br> <strong>and paid for!</strong> ðŸ¤¯</p>
                <p class="blog-par">But, I didn't know how to code, so I used nocode tools like Carrd, Zapier, and Webflow.</p>

                    <p class="blog-bold">What I was doing before</p>
                    <p class="blog-par">
                        Before this, I was working in digital marketing. I managed over $50 million in paid ads for fintech, software, and eCommerce brands.
                        My last company was an AI marketing company where we used AI to optimize campaigns and gain deeper insights into paid marketing campaigns.
                        Tired of working remotely in LA, I moved to Paris with my girlfriend in 2022 to mix things up.
                        </p>
                    <p class="blog-bold">What I'm doing now</p>
                    <p class="blog-par">
                        I quit my last job and enrolled into the Scrimba Frontend Developer Bootcamp in Jan 2023 with the goal of landing my first software engineering role in 3 months.
                        I spend at least 3-4 hours per day coding, completing solo projects, and getting code reviews.
                        So far, the experience has been incredible! The community on Discord is supportive and responsive.
                        I don't attend the weekly calls as much as I should, but that's something I hope to change this week.
