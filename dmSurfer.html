                <p>I built a Chrome extension that helps you write personalized messages 2x faster on LinkedIn and connect with Technical Recruiters.  <br>

                    <p class="blog-par">I used HTML and CSS to build and design the page. Then, I used Javascript and the OpenAPI API to write personalized messages based on the input fields. </p>
                    <p class="blog-bold">What problems did I overcome?</p>
                    <p class="blog-par">I struggled writing the API request and initially used the wrong OpenAI model. After many attempts, I managed to get it working. The next issue I had was passing the data from the input fields to the API request. This was important because I needed to feed the AI data about the person I was messaging and the job description. These are critical components of a cold message. <br> When launching to the Chrome Store, I committed my project to Github which led to OpenAI disabling my API keys üò≠. This took me down the rabbit hole of ENV, config.js, and hiding API keys. After trial and error, I was able to replace my public API key with a hidden one that worked and didn't get disabled by OpenAI.üéâ  </p>
