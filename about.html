                            <p>I love challenging myself and learning new things.
                                After 5 years of managing <strong>$50 million dollars</strong> in paid ads, I decided to focus on building products. 
                                In 2022, I built <strong>10+ web apps</strong> using "nocode" tools that have gotten <strong>1,000+</strong> users and over <strong>$25,000</strong> in revenue.
                                Now, I want to go deeper. In 2023, I enrolled in the Scrimba Frontend Developer Bootcamp.

                <p class="blog-bold">How I stay committed to learning</p>
                <p class="blog-par">I consider myself a lifelong learner. I get excited thinking about the 10k hour journey to mastery. For programming, my approach is to create simple projects using what I've learned from my bootcamp, or work new techniques into existing projects (like using ChatGPT's API to make a chatbot to improve my french).</p>
                <p class="blog-par">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
                <p class="blog-par">Every day, I spend <strong>at least</strong> 2 hours of focused time learning and practicing newly acquired information -- whether it's
                                    related to coding, marketing, Stoicism, or Brazilian Ju-Jitsu (<strong>PS: I'm obsessed!</strong> ðŸ¥‹)
                </p>
                    
                <p class="blog-bold">How I got started</p>
                <p class="blog-par">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                <p class="blog-par">That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>

                <p>I spent the first month reviewing HTML, CSS, JS, and built 6 solo projects! I learned how to build static pages using CSS grid and how to use JS to make my sites come to life!
