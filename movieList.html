                    <p class="blog-bold">How I built it</p>
                    <p class="blog-par">Using the usual arsenal of HTML, CSS, and JS. This time I had to use the OMDB API and make two GET requests with a series of FOR loops to display the data for each movie. </p>
                    <p class="blog-bold">What problems did I overcome?</p>
                    <p class="blog-par">It was not easy creating and running the callback functions and FOR loops. Not to mention I had to pre-design the page so that when I made my API call, the data would be injected into the right places. This took at least 1-2 days of CSS work. I had to learn how to call two GET requests and use ASYNC / AWAIT. At some point the code became a mess. I refactored my code which led to a deeper understanding of what was going on.</p>
