                    <p>My goal is to learn something new every day. I love the Japanese philosophy of "kaizen" -- the art of improving 1% daily. I aim for at least 2 hours of focused effort.</p>
                    <p class="main-post__paragrah-title"> How I got started </p>
                    <p> I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
